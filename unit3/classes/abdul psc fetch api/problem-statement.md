Create a products catalog in products.html. Get the products from [fakestoreapi.com](http://fakestoreapi.com). Find the correct API link in docs.

Each product should have an Add to Cart Button. Clicking product will add it to the cart. Show the cart count on top RHS of navbar.

Products page should have sorting functionality pricewise ( High to low and Low to High ).

Add filter by price range functionality ( 500-1000Rs, 1000-2000 Rs etc)

Create a cart.html where the user should be able to see all the products they added to the cart. If a user applies 'masai30' as a coupon code, they get a 30% discount.

Create a checkout.html page, where users should be able to add their address and go to the payments page.

On the payment.html page, users can enter their dummy debit card details and click on 'place order' button.

Once an order is placed, show a confirmation message 'Your order is successfully placed' after 3 seconds.
