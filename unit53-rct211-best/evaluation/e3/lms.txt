Testing Objectives
The user should be able to create his own custom hooks, that cover most of the edge-cases, related to its functionality.
The user should be able to create his own custom React components. The components should function properly when the user passes the required props.

Part-1 : Custom Hooks
Implement the following hook
useCounter
useCounter hook accepts 3 numbers, initialCount, minCount, maxCount:
const { countValue, incCount, decCount } = useCounter({
  initialCount: 10,
  minCount: 5,
  maxCount: 15,
});
Where countValue is the current value of the counter, and rest are functions
incCount increments counter, incCount(2): increments by 2, incCount(5): increments by 5, etc. if not given, default is 1: incCount()
decCount decrements counter, decCount(2): decrements by 2, decCount(5): decrements by 5, etc. if not given, default is 1: decCount()
User should not be able to increment the count if it is more than or equal to the maxValue
User should not be able to decrement the count if it is less than or equal to the minValue
Part-2 : React Custom Components
Create the following custom components in react
Button:
A custom button that accepts the following props and changes the default properties:
colorScheme, size, variant
colorScheme has following values:red, yellow, orange, green. The default value must be white, if colorScheme is not specified.
size has the following values: sm, md, lg, xl. You can decide what the values are going to be for these sizes. The default value must be md if not given.
variant has the following values: solid, ghost, and outline. Reference
Reference inspiration
Pagination:
Simple Pagination component that accepts following props:
total, selected, onPageChange
total decides how many pages will be there. eg: <Pagination total={10}>
selected decides which page is currently selected.
onPageChange is a callback when user changes page number.
Reference inspiration
Inside this component there are prev and next buttons as well.
eg: <Pagination total={5}> creates 7 boxes inside:
[<][1][2][3][4][5][>]
prev and next are disabled when there's no prev and next page available.
Selected page must be highlighted with a blue border
Hint: Pagination component will need one more PageCell component which represents one single box
